# BRONZE CHALLENGE:
1. Create a list of value types. (int, string, bool, float, double, decimal)
2. Create two examples for each type. One is a declaration only. The other is a declaration with initializer.
3. Print a view of the values in the console.

<!--
int i1;
i1 = 10;
int i2 = 10;

double d1;
d1 = 20.0d;
double d2 = 20.0d;

string s1;
s1 = "Hello World!";
string s2 = "Hello World!";
-->

# SILVER CHALLENGE:
1. Use those types to concatenate a string. 

<!--
Console.WriteLine($"i1 = {i1}");
Console.WriteLine($"i2 = {i2}");
Console.WriteLine($"d1 = {d1}");
Console.WriteLine($"d1 = {d2}");
Console.WriteLine($"d1 = {d1}");
Console.WriteLine($"d1 = {s2}");    
-->

# GOLD CHALLENGE:
